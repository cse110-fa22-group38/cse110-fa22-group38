### Assignment:

For CSE 110 at UC San Diego we are tasked with building a _CRUD_ app using _core web technologies_ (HTML/CSS/JS) which organizes _personal data_ with a focus on _local first_ design.

### Our Project

We decided to build a planner for this project. As a school which uses quarters rather than symesters, most time management tools are not built for our schedules. So we wanted to make a planner specifically designed around being used for quarters.
