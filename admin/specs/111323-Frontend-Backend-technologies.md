  - Other alternative was react which has a lot of technological overhead in attempt to improve developer experience especially given our simple usecase
  - Simple to use and all the team members were proficient in the same
- Vanilla JS

  - Easier for making Web components

### Backend
- ExpressJS
  - Not a very steep learning curve
  - Other alternative was PHP which has a very steep learning curve and overcomplicated stuff for our team

- Database
  - Postgresql
    - More funcitonality than SQLITE
    - Relational Database
    - Faster queries and more efficient data storage
