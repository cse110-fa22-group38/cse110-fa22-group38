## Group Contract
1. Psychological Safety
	- safe space, no prejudice
	- Share ideas without hesitation (shouldn’t worry about other people attacking your ideas)
	- Be 100% honest on where you’re at. If you’re stuck on something or have emergencies, tell us. We will work it out.
2. Conflicts
	- For example, if there is no clear majority. Team leads can be decisive and steer the group into a certain direction.
	- Understanding the situation. 
	- Neutral party (team leads, TA). 1:1 meeting.
3. Commitments
	- 15-20 minutes per day for the project => 1-2 hours per week. Expect some crunch near deadlines.
	- Scrum master (Tung) keeps track of progress (Notifying people that other people need help and keeping track of everyone’s progress).
	- Buffer days when things go wrong. (soft deadlines are Fridays, hard deadlines are Saturday)
	- Break bigger tasks into multiple smaller tasks.
4. Github issues & future meetings
	- Weekly tasks will be published on: Monday (30 - 45 minutes)
	- Midweek check: Wednesday (15 - 20 minutes)
	- Scrum master will check in with everyone on where they are at and which part they are stuck at.
	- Daily standups: Daily (shouldn’t take more than 5 minutes)
### Notes
