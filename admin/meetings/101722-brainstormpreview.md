## Brainstorming Meeting
Requirements for this week:
- meeting(s) for brainstorming of length 2+ hours.

How we will approach it:
- we will extend Friday meeting to 2 hours
	- you are expected to **attend at least 1 hour**, but try to attend the entire meeting
	- you can add ideas to the Miro board ahead of this meeting
	- we will flesh out ideas, and attempt to narrow down to 3â€“5 ideas to vote on
	- you should come prepared with an idea for the project and a Miro account
- next week's Monday sync will be used to go narrow down ideas and we will hand out tasks/instructions for preparing our **idea pitch** to Allison

### Miro Board
This will be where most of our initial planning lives. You can add ideas to the board from now through our meeting on Friday, and during the meeting we will build out and combine ideas.

Note:
- make an account on Miro
- Divyam will send out invitations for a board

## Contact Information
Communication is very important for deliverables, so it would be great if admin (Divyam & John) have access to emergency contact information for everyone. This will be done using phone numbers. To decrease the likelihood of needing to contact someone outside of Slack, we also ask everyone to install Slack's mobile  app on their phones **with all notifications on**.

## Notes
- Friday meeting: 2 hours (not sure when to be exact, probably 1-3pm)
- Small meeting on Monday: 30 minutes ish (will be Zoom-based)
  + Deadlines are usually on Mondays so we will be completing tasks during
    the week.

# TODO:
- set up Miro account (education if you have time)
	- ping Divyam for assistance
	- go to test board to play around with the tools
	- practice board [https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPMz1Nf8=/?share_link_id=546256359416](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPMz1Nf8=/?share_link_id=546256359416)
- come up with *some* idea for the project (more is better)
- fill out *google form* with phone number
- install slack on your phone with notifications on
