## Project Pitch
We have to create a pitch to submit to Allison for approval
- Google Slides
	- link will be posted in slack/assignments
- will complete based on your part of the project
- we need to assign roles! (cont. below)
**The sooner this is completed, the sooner we can begin working on the project**
Our goal is to _get the bare-bones_ of the project started this week

## Checkins
We will start checking in on team members this week
- on Wednesday expect a message from someone (probably Tung) regarding what you've completed
- daily check-in using standup bots, will probably start later in the week

## Role Assignments
We need to assign roles for the project
- expect a google form to go out soon asking where you would like to work
	- note you may not get what you want, somebody has to be assigned to each role.
- groups for each section will have their own leader to interface with management (Divyam, John, & Tung) think _tree_.

expect role assignments by Wednesday
