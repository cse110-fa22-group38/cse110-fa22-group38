## TODO AFTER MEETING
1) Deciding which idea we should go with. Ideally by <span style="color:red"> **Monday's Noon** </span> so we can propose to Allison and get started early.
2) Think about which role you want to do (once we have decided the project)
3) (Optional) Deciding which group bonding activity we want to do.
